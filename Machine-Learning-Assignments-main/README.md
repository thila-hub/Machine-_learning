## Contents

### Supervised Learning Algorithms
1. **Decision Tree** - A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
2. **KNN Algorithm** - K-Nearest Neighbors, a simple and effective algorithm for classification and regression.
3. **Logistic Regression** - A statistical model for binary classification.
4. **Multiple Regression** - A model that considers multiple features to predict a target variable.
5. **Naive Bayes Algorithm** - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
6. **Polynomial Regression** - Extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms.
7. **Random Forest** - An ensemble method for classification and regression by building multiple decision trees.
8. **Support Vector Machine** - A powerful classification algorithm for separating data.

### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
1. **DBScan** - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, used for clustering data.
2. **KMeans Clustering** - A popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters.

### Datasets
